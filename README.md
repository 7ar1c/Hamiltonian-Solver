A code to find the probability of a spin-1 particle being in each of its basis states after a time "t" given a time-independent Hamiltonian "H" and initial state "initial". 
P0 is probability of quantum state ket(0), P1 represents ket(1) and Pm1 represents ket(-1).
Next steps will be generalizing to find the probability of the particle being in any spin 1 state, rather than just in one of the basis states.
